I want to understand proofs better and be able to write some too.

## Sets

### Introduction to Sets

A __set__ is a collection of things. The things are called elements of the set.

An __infinity set__ has infinity many elements; otherwise it is called a __finite__ set.

Two sets are __equal__ if they conatin exact the same elements.

The set of __natural numbers__ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}" title="\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}" />

The set of __integers__ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}" title="\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}" />

If X is a finite set, its __cardinality__ or __size__ is the number of elements it has, and this number is denoted as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|X|">

__Set-builder notation__ is used to describe sets.

Definition 1.1 An ordered pair is a list (x, y) of two things x and y, enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma.

Definition 1.2 The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another set, denoted as A×B and defined as A×B={(a,b):a ∈ A,b ∈ B}.

Fact 1.1 If A and B are finite sets, then |A×B|=|A|·|B|.
