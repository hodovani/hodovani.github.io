I want to understand proofs better and be able to write some too.

## Sets

### Introduction to Sets

A __set__ is a collection of things. The things are called elements of the set.

An __infinity set__ has infinity many elements; otherwise it is called a __finite__ set.

Two sets are __equal__ if they conatin exact the same elements.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=7 \notin A">

The set of __natural numbers__ <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots}">

The set of __integers__ <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots}">

If X is a finite set, its __cardinality__ or __size__ is the number of elements it has, and this number is denoted as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|X|">
