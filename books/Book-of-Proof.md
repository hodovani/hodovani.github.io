I want to understand proofs better and be able to write some too.

## Sets

### Introduction to Sets

A __set__ is a collection of things. The things are called elements of the set.

An __infinity set__ has infinity many elements; otherwise it is called a __finite__ set.

Two sets are __equal__ if they conatin exact the same elements.

The set of __natural numbers__ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}" title="\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}" />

The set of __integers__ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}" title="\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}" />

If X is a finite set, its __cardinality__ or __size__ is the number of elements it has, and this number is denoted as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|X|">

__Set-builder notation__ is used to describe sets.

__Definition 1.1__ An ordered pair is a list (x, y) of two things x and y, enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma.

__Definition 1.2__ The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is another set, denoted as A×B and defined as A×B={(a,b):a ∈ A,b ∈ B}.

*Fact 1.1* If A and B are finite sets, then |A×B|=|A|·|B|.

__Definition 1.3__ Suppose A and B are sets. If every element of A is also an element of B, then we say A is a subset of B, and we denote this as A ⊆ B. We write A ⊈ B if A is not a subset of B, that is, if it is not true that every element of A is also an element of B. Thus A ⊈ B means that there is at least one element of A that is not an element of B.

*Fact 1.2* The empty set is a subset of all sets, that is,∅ ⊆ B for any set B.

*Fact 1.3* If a finite set has n elements, then it has 2n subsets.

__Definition 1.4__ If A is a set, the power set of A is another set, denoted as 𝒫(A) and defined to be the set of all subsets of A. In symbols, 𝒫(A) = {X : X ⊆ A}.

*Fact 1.4* If A is a finite set, then |P(A)| = 2^(|A|).

The set 𝒫(ℝ^2) is mind boggling. Think of ℝ^2 = {(x,y) : x,y ∈ ℝ} as the set of all points on the Cartesian plane.
