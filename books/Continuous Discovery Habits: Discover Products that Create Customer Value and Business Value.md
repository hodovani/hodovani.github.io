### What I want to archive with this book?
A: I want to answer on these questions:

### What other people think about this book?

- A book that will take you through the process of doing research-backed product work step-by-step.
- It also has a pattern for practice based books where each chapter ends with a “Common Anti-Patterns” section where it lists the ways you can mess up a particular approach.
- A must-read for all that can't wait to have continuous product discovery as their standard practice.
- It is a step-by-step guide to product discovery.
- There are many books about discovery techniques as "Sprint", "Testing Business Ideas", "The Lean Product Playbook", "The Mom Test", etc. But there is any which covers the discovery approach as a whole from an organizational, strategic perspective. "Continuous Discovery Habits" fills this gap.
- In the last chapter Teresa Torres writes that she had the same challenges as every product manager and tells a secret how she overcame those obstacles. After the read, you really believe you can start doing discovery no matter what!
- The book focuses on the question "what to build", which can be daunting looking at the universe of possible options. Teresa Torres provides practical and concrete methodologies to clarify a problem and structure the opportunity space.
