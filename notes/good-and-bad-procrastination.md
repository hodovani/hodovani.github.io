Richard Hamming suggests that you ask yourself three questions:

1.What are the most important problems in your field?
2.Are you working on one of them?
3.Why not?

Hamming's exercise can be generalized to: What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?

Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically, fear of wasting time. What if they fail? Then all the time they spent on it will be wasted. (In fact it probably won't be, because work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)
