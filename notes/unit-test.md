A __unit__ test is a piece of a code (usually a method) that invokes another piece of code and checks the correctness of some assumptions afterward. If the assumptions turn out to be wrong, the unit test has failed. A unit is a method or function.

## Use Inversion of Controll to make unit more testable.

`filterFn` gives us more controll on `filter` and make it easier to test.

```javascript
function filter(array, filterFn) {
  let newArray = []
  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    const element = array[index]
    if (filterFn(element)) {
      newArray[newArray.length] = element
    }
  }
  return newArray
}
```

Tests show how to use your code. It can help to understand the code without documentation.


## Tests should run in parallel. Why? It should speedup build. It enshure that tests are independent.


Compare Parralel and Single Thread test running

## Parameterized Test to avoid code duplication

Pros

- DRY
- Easy to add new test

Cons

- Hard to debug

## Draft notes

- Add test execution to build pipeline
- Should we test code perfomance? How? Add actions metrics to the test
- Stress testing? Extreme cases? 
- Think how you would test the code before write it
- positive and negative tests
