Node.js Example: Reinforcement Learning with MountainCar Simulation

---

### Why create this tutorial?

I wanted to have fun and intresting project to work on weekends, learn more about Reinforcement Learning, create a bot that would play .io games for me.

### Why Node.js?

I am comfortable to work with JavaScript. 

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Short notes from the book https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf

Is it different from superrvised learning? What examples? Elements of Reinforcement Learning. Limitations and Scope.

### What is mountain car Simulation?

### Why mountain car Simulation?

This can be ["Hello World!"](https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/23563/32201) problem of RL.

### Code example and explanation.
