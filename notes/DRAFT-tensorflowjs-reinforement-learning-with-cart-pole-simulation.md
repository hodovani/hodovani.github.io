TensorFlow.js Example: Reinforcement Learning with Cart-Pole Simulation

---

### Why create this tutorial?

I wanted to have fun and intresting project to work on weekends, learn more about Reinforcement Learning, create a bot that would play .io games for me.

### Why TensorFlow.js?

I am comfortable to work with JavaScript. TensorFlow has lot of examples, tutorials, ready to use models.

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

### What is Cart-Pole Simulation?

### Why Cart-Pole Simulation?

This can be ["Hello World!"](https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/23563/32201) problem of RL.
