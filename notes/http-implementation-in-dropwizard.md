# How HTTP implemented in dropwizard?

## What is dropwizard?

Dropwizard straddles the line between being a library and a framework. Its goal is to provide performant, reliable implementations of everything a production-ready web application needs. Because this functionality is extracted into a reusable library, your application remains lean and focused, reducing both time-to-market and maintenance burdens.

Because you canâ€™t be a web application without HTTP, Dropwizard uses the Jetty HTTP library to embed an incredibly tuned HTTP server directly into your project. Instead of handing your application off to a complicated application server, Dropwizard projects have a main method which spins up an HTTP server. Running your application as a simple process eliminates a number of unsavory aspects of Java in production (no PermGen issues, no application server configuration and maintenance, no arcane deployment tools, no class loader troubles, no hidden application logs, no trying to tune a single garbage collector to work with multiple application workloads) and allows you to use all of the existing Unix process management tools instead.

## What is HTTP?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
