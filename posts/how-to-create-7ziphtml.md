### Tl;DR

You want to go to [unzip](https://unzip.mpds.io) and play with it. You can use [this](https://unzip.mpds.io/?archiveUrl=https://mpds.io/calculations/NaCl_225_cF8.7z) example if you don't have a 7zip archive.

here is a short animation that shows you how to use this tool.

I'll show you how to build this tool.

### Intro

Welcome to my tutorial!

We would answer some questions first.

#### What is 7zip.html?

It is a tool to open archives in your browser. Your data wouldn't leave your machine.

#### Why do we need this?

Sometimes you just need to have a look at a specific file in your archive and you don't want to install additional software to do this.

#### How would we do this?

We would use a WebAssembly port of a tool. We would create a wrapper around it to make it easier for a user.

### Core

We would use libarchivejs to look inside archive. Let's try the code from their example.

We need to setup [libarchivejs](https://github.com/nika-begiashvili/libarchivejs) to run in browser.

1. Run libarchivejs in browser
2. Create web interface

Video should be like a presentation. Not live codding session.
