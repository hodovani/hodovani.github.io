1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS

Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve. 

2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS 

You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.

3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION 

If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.

Of course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this. There's reputation, shared values, contracts, cultural markers

What the game is, defines what the players do.
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,
it's that our environment acts against the evolution of trust. 

That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game. 

So, do what you can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust. Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together to live and let live
