I used an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) base blog as a start template. You can find it [here](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog#getting-started).
Please, follow the steps in README.md to create a blog.

I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish my blog. A [link](https://github.com/hodovani/hodovani.github.io) to a blog repository.

You need to deploy your blog to the GitHub Pages repository to publish it.

I made changes to `.eleventy.js` to build blog to the root folder. I want to
have one repository that is responsible for the blog. So this one contains
builded blog and a a source code.

I added Google Analytics to track and report website traffic. Here is a [link](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en)

You can find previous versions of this blog [here](https://github.com/hodovani/hodovani.github.io/commits/master/_source/posts/firstpost.md)

Hope this was helpful.
Feel free to write to me.
